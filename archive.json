I agree that a url based solution is best, but I think we should describe why a url based solution is needed with abstract requirements.\r\n\r\nI agree that sending binary data is an entirely plausible solution that has some nice benefits. However, I read these requirements as having selected the url-based approach and elevating some side benefits of that approach to requirements to necessitate that being the only viable solution. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(Req-SmoothUX) Solution SHALL allow for user experience where neither Sender nor Receiver is presented with\r\nraw data required only by the secure transfer protocol. The data SHOULD only be parsed programmatically and\r\nnot required to be presented to the end user. This data SHOULD never be visible to said user in whichever\r\nmessaging application the sender chose to initiate the transfer on. This eliminates the possibility of\r\nmerely sending the requisite data inline, through an SMS or email for example, rather than leveraging an\r\nintermediary server.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis requirement seems to rule out anything besides a url-based solution. If this is the direction we want to go, then we should be clear about the intentions. If we are open to other solutions then we should scope these requirements to things that really are required and perhaps have a separate discussion of nice-to-haves.",

As such, I think it is more of a consideration or evaluation criteria we may want to document and not a requirement.\r\n\r\nGetting beyond the initial notion of `Solution SHALL allow for user experience `  you can see that the additional details in the requirement have nothing to do with the protocol. For example, I could write a messaging app that fetches the raw data from the URL and presents that to the user. Conversely if we sent the data in binary form I could (and would presumably) present UX to the user about accepting a key and never show them the raw data. IMO these are entirely decisions for messaging apps to make that have very little to do with the underlying protocol and thus don't belong in this document. \r\n\r\nAll that said, this is probably a discussion better had in issue #7. My suggestion here is that if the authors are actually very committed to the URL approach, we should say that rather than work backwards from that and right the requirements to fit it. ",

The data SHOULD only be parsed programmatically and not required to be presented to the end user. This data SHOULD never be visible to said user in whichever messaging application the sender chose to initiate the transfer on. This eliminates the possibility of merely sending the requisite data inline, through an SMS or email for example, rather than leveraging an Intermediary server.\r\n```\r\nAdded missing article.",

Hence the \"open ending\". But for the time being, to present this proposal to community, we believe it needs to be simple - hence, P2P application is in scope now.   Hope this makes sense",
