Conversely if we sent the data in binary form I could (and would presumably) present UX to the user about accepting a key and never show them the raw data. IMO these are entirely decisions for messaging apps to make that have very little to do with the underlying protocol and thus don't belong in this document. \r\n\r\nAll that said, this is probably a discussion better had in issue #7.
